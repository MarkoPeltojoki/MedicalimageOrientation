# Medical Image Orientation
Improving data quality in Medical imaging by predicting the orientation of the image using Microsoft Custom Vision through API calls. Custom Vision was not good enough, so the final submission with better level of predictions was created with Keras but unfortunately that Jupyter notebook is missing. Sorry.
See my BeeClassification repo for more complete Custom Vision notebooks.
